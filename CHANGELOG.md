# Changelog

All notable changes to **zing** are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] — web: Chinese findings, history/trends, advanced console

### Added

- **Findings localized to Chinese (web UI).** A new `zing/web/static/i18n.js` catalog
  maps every finding `id` (~65) to a zh title + a zh summary template filled from the
  finding's evidence (falling back to the English summary when a key is absent). The
  report and the live feed now show findings in Chinese.
- **Audit history & trends.** `zing serve` persists every audit to a local SQLite DB
  (`$ZING_DATA_DIR` or `~/.zing/history.db`, stdlib only — no new dep). New endpoints
  (`/api/history`, `/api/history/{id}`, `/api/history/trend`, DELETE) and a `/history`
  page that lists past audits grouped by target+model with a score sparkline; click a
  row to view that saved report. History never leaves your machine.
- **Advanced console view (`/console`).** A dark, power-user UI (ported from the
  console prototype) wired to the same live SSE: terminal-style detector log with
  click-to-expand evidence, dimension bars, and a verdict ring. Linked from the
  default report view; the report view links to history.

## [0.6.0] — web compare + live evidence

### Added

- **Web UI: `compare` against a trusted baseline.** The form has an optional baseline
  section (base_url / key / model / protocol); when filled, the audit runs in
  **compare** mode so the verdict gets baseline corroboration (quality_judge and
  integrity can escalate). The report shows the baseline and `mode: compare`.
- **Web UI: live evidence feed.** The scan now streams each detector's findings and
  evidence as it completes (the `detector_done` SSE event carries a compact, bounded
  findings list), so notable findings appear in real time — e.g. *"Self-identifies as
  a rival brand — self-id said: I'm Doubao, by ByteDance"* — instead of just status
  dots. `run_audit`'s `on_event` callback now includes per-detector findings.

## [0.5.0] — local web UI (`zing serve`)

### Added

- **`zing serve` — a local web UI.** A point-and-click front end for `zing check`:
  enter a relay + the model it claims, watch the audit stream **live** (a radar scan
  with per-detector progress over SSE), then get a shareable verdict report (grade,
  per-dimension breakdown, plain-language findings, downloadable JSON). Runs entirely
  on your machine — keys typed in the browser reach only your local server and the
  target relay, never a third party. New optional extra: `pip install 'zing-audit[web]'`
  (fastapi + uvicorn). `run_audit` gained an `on_event` progress callback that powers
  the live stream.

## [0.4.0] — agent/LLM ergonomics

Make zing pleasant to drive from another program or model.

### Added

- **`--compact`** (`check`/`compare`) — a lean, agent-facing JSON verdict on stdout:
  verdict + per-dimension status + a flat findings list, *without* the bulky
  per-finding evidence. ~66% smaller than `--json` (a standard report drops from
  ~5.2k to ~1.8k tokens).
- **`--dry-run`** (`check`/`compare`) — print the detectors that would run and an
  estimated API-call count (honoring `--reliability-requests`) **without making any
  requests**, so an agent can budget cost first. Each detector now carries a
  `cost_hint`.
- **`kb --json`** and **`models --json`** — machine-readable discovery of the bundled
  knowledge base and of an endpoint's advertised model list.
- **Structured errors in machine mode.** In `--json`/`--compact` mode a config/usage
  error now prints `{"error": {...}}` to stdout (exit 2) instead of a human message,
  so a pipeline can parse failures uniformly.
- Top-level `--help` now documents the agent flags.

## [0.3.0] — accuracy pass on real relays (DeepSeek / Doubao)

Validated against live endpoints (DeepSeek official + Aliyun, Volcengine, …): honest
DeepSeek relays now read CLEAN, and Doubao models passed off as DeepSeek are caught HIGH.

### Added

- **`--claimed-model`** — audit an endpoint's *real* model id against a *different*
  claimed model's profile (e.g. request `doubao-seed-...` but verify it against the
  `deepseek-v4-flash` profile). Lets you confirm a suspected substitution end-to-end.

### Fixed

- **Billing false positives on reasoning models / non-OpenAI tokenizers.** A reasoning
  model's `completion_tokens` legitimately includes hidden reasoning tokens the
  visible-text estimate can't see, and heuristic (non-tiktoken) estimates are
  imprecise — these no longer produce a "token inflation" HIGH. Prompt-token thresholds
  widen for heuristic tokenizers, and prompt-padding is still checked when a reasoning
  model returns empty visible content. (DeepSeek official went MEDIUM → CLEAN.)
- **Substitution false negatives.** Model-identity now flags ANY known vendor brand
  that isn't the model's own — including Doubao/ByteDance, Kimi, GLM, Hunyuan, Ernie,
  MiniMax (with Chinese names) — so a substitute the per-model KB list never enumerated
  is still caught. (A "I'm Doubao, by ByteDance" relay sold as DeepSeek now reads HIGH.)
- KB: added DeepSeek's native brand name (深度求索) to the deepseek profiles so a
  genuine model using it isn't mis-flagged.

## [0.2.1]

### Fixed

- `zing --version` now reports the actual installed version. It was hardcoded in
  `zing/__init__.py` and reported `0.1.0` for the 0.2.0 release; the version is now
  single-sourced from package metadata (`importlib.metadata`) so it can never drift
  from `pyproject.toml`.

## [0.2.0] — Anthropic support & roadmap security detectors

### Added

- **Anthropic Messages API support.** zing now audits Anthropic-native relays
  (`/v1/messages`) as well as OpenAI Chat Completions, behind one detector
  interface. The protocol is auto-detected from the base_url/model or forced with
  `--api openai|anthropic` (and `--target-api` / `--baseline-api` for `compare`).
- **Three new `deep`-suite security detectors** (formerly roadmap):
  - `injected_prompt` — detects a hidden, silently-prepended system prompt from a
    large *fixed* input-token overhead (measured across two message sizes) plus a
    leak probe; needs both signals to warn.
  - `integrity` — known-answer URL/package canaries catch in-flight response/tool-call
    tampering (value substituted, structure preserved). CRITICAL only when a trusted
    baseline returns the canary intact; otherwise MEDIUM.
  - `prompt_cache` — flags prompt-prefix caching by TTFT timing (informational; states
    that cross-user cache sharing is not provable from a single key).
- Automated PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions + Trusted Publishing
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`); see `docs/PUBLISHING.md`.

## [0.1.0] — first public alpha

First public release. A local-first CLI that audits whether an OpenAI-compatible
API relay (中转站 / reseller / proxy) actually serves the model it claims to —
or quietly substitutes a cheaper one, truncates the context window, fakes
streaming, or inflates token billing (货不对板检测).

### Added

- `zing check` — audit one relay endpoint against what it claims (model id +
  optional provider hint).
- `zing compare` — audit a relay against a trusted baseline of the same declared
  model (the strongest downgrade evidence).
- `zing models` — probe an endpoint's `GET /v1/models` list.
- `zing kb` — inspect the bundled knowledge base.
- `zing init` — write a starter `zing.yaml` config.
- Eleven detectors across nine scored dimensions: model identity & downgrade
  fingerprinting, real context window & truncation, capability claims, token/usage
  billing, streaming authenticity, OpenAI-protocol conformance, determinism/cache
  correctness, concurrent reliability, transport/secret-handling security, plus
  connectivity and an optional LLM-judged quality assessment (`--judge`).
- Bundled knowledge base of **85 native model profiles across 7 platforms**
  (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Moonshot), editable as
  YAML and overridable via `--kb-dir` / `ZING_KB_DIR`.
- Two detection modes: pure-code deterministic probes (default) and a code+LLM
  hybrid that consults a separate trusted judge model.
- JSON, Markdown, and HTML reports; `--json` for machine/agent consumption.
- Evidence-first verdicts (CLEAN / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / INCONCLUSIVE) with
  confidence, designed to avoid false accusations of honest relays.
- Secret hygiene: API keys are fingerprinted (never stored) and relay-controlled
  text is redacted before it reaches any report (JSON/Markdown/HTML).
- `--fail-under` / `--fail-on-risk` exit-code gates for CI use.
